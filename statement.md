Problem Statement
In daily life, academics, engineering, cooking, and travel, people frequently need to convert units of length (e.g., meters to feet), weight (e.g., kg to pounds), and temperature (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit). Performing these conversions manually using formulas is time-consuming, tedious, and often leads to calculation errors. Many students and professionals rely on online tools that require an internet connection or mobile apps that are bloated and contain ads.
There is a clear need for a simple, accurate, offline, and lightweight unit conversion tool that works instantly without any dependencies.
Scope of the Project
This project develops a Universal Unit Converter in Python that supports conversion across three major measurement categories:

Length: meter, centimeter, kilometer, mile, foot, inch
Weight/Mass: gram, kilogram, pound, ounce
Temperature: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin (bidirectional)

The application is designed as a console-based tool with a focus on usability, accuracy, and extensibility. It serves as a practical demonstration of core programming concepts while solving a real-world problem.
Target Users

Students (school and college)
Teachers and academic professionals
Engineers and technicians
Travelers and homemakers
Beginners learning Python programming
Anyone needing quick offline unit conversion

High-Level Features

Interactive menu-driven interface
Support for multiple units in each category with bidirectional conversion
Real-time accurate calculations using standard conversion formulas
Robust input validation and error handling (prevents crashes on invalid input)
Option to perform unlimited conversions in a single run
Clean and formatted output display
Modular code design for easy maintenance and future expansion
100% offline — no internet or external libraries required
Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

This project successfully bridges the gap between theoretical programming concepts and practical utility, delivering a reliable tool that can be used daily.
